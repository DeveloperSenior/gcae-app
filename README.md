# Project's name
`GCAE FRAMEWORK for generating the BACK-END of an application from JSON objects (JSON-NODEJS Generator) under SOLID principles` software that automates the process of generating base code with standard architectures within the framework of SOLID principles focused on the Back-end.

# Back-End Project Structure
The project was developed for the back-end with NodeJS v20.17.0 LTS, using the following support libraries:

1. `express` for the creation of the container
Rest API server and usage
2. `nodemon` tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when changes are detected in the files in the directory.
3. `rxjs` Library of reactive extensions for JavaScript
4. `fluent-json-schema` JSON Schema Generator
5. `ajv` JSON structure validator based on javascript object schemas (JSON).
6. `swagger-jsdoc`, `swagger-model-validator`, `swagger-ui-express` This module allows you to serve API documents automatically generated by swagger-ui from Express, based on a swagger spec with `swagger-jsdoc`. The result is live documentation for the API hosted from the API server through a route.
7. `mongoose` as ODM to persist JSON documents in MongoDB and`mongoose-paginate-v2` to perform paginated queries to MongoDB.
8. `jsonwebtoken` to authenticate and authorize each transaction in the API exposed by `express`.
9. `bcrypt` to encrypt and validate passwords that are stored in MongoDB
10. `AWS SDK` Allows to connect your application to Amazon AWS services
11. `adm-zip` ADM-ZIP is a pure JavaScript implementation for zip data compression for NodeJS.
12. `helmet` Helmet helps secure Express apps by setting HTTP response headers. [Doc Site](https://helmetjs.github.io/)

# How to run the project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone
https://github.com/DeveloperSenior/gcae-app.git
```
2. **Install node modules:**
```bash
cd gcae-app
npm install
```
3. **Run unit tests with JEST:**
```bash
npm run test
```
*NOTE:* To view TEST report `./build/report/jest-report/jest_html_reporters.html` and the coverage report open the file`./coverage/index.html`

4. **Run the local application:**

**NOTE:** Before running the server, make sure to check the following:

* The S3 environment on AWS is created correctly, see how to configure it [here](#setting-up-s3-environment-on-aws)
* The `.env-example` file and convert it to `.env` so that the server takes the initial configuration parameters.


```bash
npm run runDev
```

5. **Run the local application into DOCKER:**
View Dockerfile & compose.yaml configuration and configure ENV needed to run the application

```bash
# into gcae-app folder run next script docker compose
docker compose up -d
```
**NOTE:** Only if you need to down your docker app services

```bash
# into gcae-app folder run next script docker compose
docker compose down
```

6. Open in browser http://localhost:3000/api/v1/version If you answer a `JSON` so:
```json
{"version": "1.0"}
```
It means that our server is up.

7. **View Documentation :**
The API documentation is in the url http://localhost:3000/api/v1/api-docs/

8. **Postman collection :**
In the Postman tool import the file `gcae-app.postman_collection` which is at the root of the project.

9. **(Optional) Run scan code security with snyk:**

```bash
# install snyk with npm
npm install -g snyk

# login snyk
snyk auth

# scan code with report
snyk test --report

```

# Setting up S3 environment on AWS

**NOTE:** Before running the script, be sure to check your AWS CLI credentials, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

```bash
# into gcae-app folder run next script
npm run update-s3-templates
```

This script packages the required code generator templates from the `./resources/s3/` folder and uploads them to the S3 bucket configured in the `BUCKET_TEMPLATE` environment variable in the `.env` file.
